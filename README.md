This repository (testiprepo) works as my dumpsite for all projects, files and whatever else I come up with while learning and practicing HTML, CSS and JavaScript at DigiTalents Academy coding workshop. Possibly even after my workshop tenure.
Re-organizing things back & forth whenever deemed necessary.
Current structure;
Main is the... main branch. Only updating it as I've confirmed both ends to be up-to-date.
Kotibranch is the home branch, ie. the branch I dump stuff in from home PC.
Pajabranch is the workshop branch, where I dump stuff from the workshop environment.
Testibranch is a testing ground, currently void of any life, but likely getting something going on later.
