This folder includes the HTML files for the projects done with the guidance of SuperSimpleDev's JavaScript youtube tutorial.
Originally in the video HTML files weren't separated into their own folder, but rather were located in the "main-folder" which also contained the folders for scripts and styles, but I personally wanted to move the HTMLs into their own folder, since there are so many of them.
When it comes to the exercise projects, ie. "4a", "4b" etc., originally I started with making a new file for each, but later started doing multiple in the same file, simply commenting out the previous code and leaving the instruction / goal visible.
Comments for early exercises/projects added later on, and as such are much more barebones/unspecific
